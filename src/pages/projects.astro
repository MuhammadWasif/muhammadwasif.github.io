      I've started companies and worked in engineering at several startups.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I was 15, my technical blog was growing fast, and getting hundreds of
      thousands of readers around the world. That was the point when recruiters
      from various companies started reaching out. I loved startups because of
      the fast-growing culture and ability to make a large impact, so I started
      by working for a few. Now, I've started my own companies, and continue to
      work fulltime in engineering too.
